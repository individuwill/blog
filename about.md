I'm Will Smith, no not that [Will Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Smith),
and welcome to my blog.

I work as a Network Engineer for a biopharmaceuticals company in northern
California. When I'm not working I can be found at the gym or with my face burried
in my laptop geeking out with some new tech or writing code.

If you find something on my blog that you like, feel free to reach out to me
via e-mail or twitter. You'll find my contact details in the footer.

In the mean-time, this blog is a work in progress and may be a series of ramblings
for some time until I figure out what I'm doing. I'm starting this blog to
capture ideas, leave a trail of documentation for my projects, and hone my
writing skills.
